Implement an assembly language program that evaluates a prefixed mathematical
expression and then displays the result at stdout. The numbers that appear in
the expression are integers with a sign, on 32 bits, and the operations that
apply to them are: +, -, /, *. The prefixed expression will be received in the
form of an AST (abstract syntax tree) following the call of an external
function - getAST (). Reading will be done by the getAST () function on
the keyboard.
